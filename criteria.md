# Acceptance criteria — The Unofficial Guide

Five criteria that say what "working" means for this system, written in unit 1
**before** any results existed.

An acceptance criterion names a target: a number, a count, a rate, or something
a person could plainly observe. *"Retrieval works"* is an opinion. *"For at
least 4 of my 5 test questions, the top results include a chunk containing the
answer"* is a criterion.

Under each one, write a sentence or two on **why that target** and not a
stricter or looser one. A reason that says something about your corpus or your
pipeline earns credit; *"80% seemed reasonable"* does not.

> Missing your own targets next unit costs you nothing. Setting a target so
> easy you can't miss it does.

## 1. Retrieved chunks contain the answer

For at least 4 of my 5 test questions, the retrieved chunks include one that
contains the answer.

**Why this target:**
<!-- e.g. "One of my questions is about a topic only two documents mention, so
     I expect that one to be hard." -->
     One of my questions is about a topic thats only mentioned in 1 document, so retriveal for that specific question might be harder.

## 2. Every answer names a source

Every answer the system produces names at least one source document.

**Why this target:**
<!-- Why all five and not four? What about your setup makes that achievable —
     or what would have to go wrong for it not to be? -->
The two optuins for answering questions is that the answer is pulled from a source, or the information simply does not exist in the source, which would count as out of corpus. Every answer having atleast one source also prevents hallucinations, or the system making something uo to answer the question. It alsi makes the information used to answer the question tracable back to the actual corpus.

## 3. The relevance gate stops out-of-corpus questions

When I ask a question my documents clearly don't cover, the relevance gate
stops it and the system returns "I don't have enough information about that" —
in at least 4 of 5 tries.

<!-- The five questions are the ones in `OUT_OF_SCOPE` at the bottom of
     `questions.py`, and `run_eval.py` puts them through the gate and writes
     what happened into your run log. Swap them for your own if you'd rather —
     just keep five of them, or the "4 of 5" above has nothing to be 4 of. -->

**Why this target:**
<!-- What did your distances look like when you set the cutoff in Milestone 4?
     Was there a clean gap, or did the two groups overlap? -->


This is done to prevent questions in which the required information to answer is not presnet in the corpus. I chose 4 out of 5 because the relevance cutoff should reject most questions that are clearly outside the corpus, while allowing for an occasional borderline retrieval result. Testing five questions also gives a more meaningful check than requiring every single question to be rejected

## 4. Something about your chunks


Each of the documents retrived for the answer becomes exactly one chunk, with its heading and its body kept together. No document is split across chunks.




<!-- YOU WRITE THIS ONE.

     How would you know if your chunks were the right size? Name something
     countable or observable.

     Examples of the right shape — don't copy these, they should come from
     what you actually saw in Milestone 3:
       - "At least 4 of 5 sampled chunks read as a complete thought, with no
          sentence cut in half at either end."
       - "No chunk is shorter than 200 characters, since anything below that
          in my corpus turned out to be a heading with no content under it." -->



**Why this target:**
I picked this target by actually analyzing the documents, and realizing all documents contain only the information relevent to the heading. Therefore, no documents would need to be split, as that would split valuable information needed for the answer into another chunk. All documents are short, and keeping each document together will prevent useful information from being seperated into different chunks.

## 5. Your choice

For at least 4 of my 5 test questions, every number in the answer appears in the document the question is about, and not in a parallel document describing a different hall, venue, or course.



<!-- YOU WRITE THIS ONE TOO.

     Pick something you actually care about getting right. It could be about
     speed, about refusals, about a particular kind of question your corpus
     handles badly, about source attribution being correct rather than merely
     present — anything, as long as it names a number or an observable
     outcome. -->



**Why this target:**
The chunks retrived could have the answer presnet, but the answer has to actually be relevent to the question. This is specifically important for numbers, where the laundry documents use very similar phrasings throughout the corpus, but the numbers are different for each phrase. This ensures the answers for the most part are accurate according to the correct document, rather than a similar document.

     UNIT 2 — read this before you change anything above.

     If a criterion turns out to be BROKEN rather than merely unmet, you can
     revise it, and that earns credit. But never delete or edit the original
     line. Add the revision underneath it, like this:

         ## 1. Retrieved chunks contain the answer

         For at least 4 of my 5 test questions, the retrieved chunks include
         one that contains the answer.

         **Why this target:** ...

         > **Revised in unit 2:** For at least 4 of 5 questions, the top three
         > results contain the answer.
         >
         > **Why revised:** I couldn't judge "the chunks include one that
         > contains the answer" the same way twice — I scored two questions
         > differently on Monday than on Wednesday. The new version is
         > something I can actually check.

     That's a revision because the criterion couldn't be MEASURED.

     Lowering a target because you missed it is not a revision, and it costs
     you the point:

         ✗ "I said 4 of 5 but got 2 of 5, so 2 of 5 is more realistic."

     A number you missed stays where it is, gets diagnosed, and gets a fix
     attempted. That's where the points are.

     The whole reason the originals stay visible is so someone can see what you
     said before you knew the answer.
